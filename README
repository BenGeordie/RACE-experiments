In this repository, we provide implementations of RACE that are 
specifically used for experimental purposes, bash scripts for
some of the experiments that we ran, and a metagenomic dataset.

RACE IMPLEMENTATIONS:
RACETresholds and RACEMulti. The source code can be found under
the "targets" directory. The binaries can be found under the 
"bin" directory.

DATASETS
We provide a metagenomic dataset sequenced using PromethION.
However, due to its large size, we were not able to upload it 
to this repository. We instead provide download instructions
under "data/PromethION_ERR3152367_DownloadInstructions.txt".
The dataset will come in FASTQ format. To classify the sequences 
into their respective taxa, run Kraken2 on this dataset with the 
--classified-out flag.

EXPERIMENT BASH SCRIPTS:
We provide scripts for both Diginorm and RACE experiments for the 
provided dataset under the "experiment_scripts" directory. There 
are two Diginorm scripts for the PromethION dataset: 
promethion_digi_optimal and promethion_digi_low_memory. As the 
names suggest, they are the optimal and low_memory runs of 
Diginorm on the PromethION dataset respectively. Note that the 
low_memory experiment cannot complete â€“ this is provided to 
showcase RACE's advantage in low-memory environments. Since the 
FASTQ file for the PromethION dataset is not provided, we have 
left the input file path blank in the PromethION bash scripts.

KRAKEN2
Instructions on installing and running Kraken can be found here:
