The PromethION dataset that we used in the experiments section 
of our paper can be retrieved from the European Nucleotide 
Archive website at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/ERR3152367.

The dataset will come in FASTQ format. To classify the sequences 
into their respective taxa, run Kraken2 on this dataset with the 
--classified-out flag.

Instructions on installing and running Kraken can be found here:
